Welcome to my Ebay redesign!

This app is a recreation of the popular ecommerce website Ebay. My project includes the following:

Home Page - Includes a nav bar for buying, selling, and messages pages as well as a navbar to search through 
different catagories (not functional).

Buying Page - this page features buttons to search through specific categories (not functional) as well as a scroll bar
for scrolling through recently bought items and recently viewed items. 

Selling Page - this page features the products you are selling at the top of the page, along with "Edit" buttons 
and "add" button to add items (buttons not functional). The Page also shows what items the user has sold, as well as the date they were sold on.

Messages Page - This page features all people the user has interacted with, along with displaying what item
is being bought or sold from this person
